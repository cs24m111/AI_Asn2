# AI Assignment 2: Search and Optimization


## Algorithms to Implement
- **Branch and Bound**
- **Iterative Deepening A***
- **Hill Climbing**
- **Simulated Annealing**

## Environments Used 
- **For Branch and Bound & Iterative Deepening A*:**
  - Frozen Lake
- **For Hill Climbing & Simulated Annealing:**
  - Traveling Salesman Problem
   - This project implements Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing algorithms for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem using the [ant_colony_opt_TSP](https://github.com/MicheleCattaneo/ant_colony_opt_TSP) environment.
